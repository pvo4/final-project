Each player and the dealer are dealt an initial 2 cards
A player's goal is to get to 21 without going over(busting) by adding up the point values of each card
A player can get blackjack or 21 by getting an Ace(A) and
any of these values 10, Jack(J), Queen(Q) or King(K)at the start of your turn
Whoever has the highest hand total between the player and dealer wins
A player can choose to hit(take a card) or stay(not take a card)
Only one card of the dealer is shown and the second is revealed when it's the dealer's turn
The dealer will hit as long as his hand total is less than 17
